- For Windows download & install it from below link:
> https://www.openlogic.com/openjdk-downloads?field_java_parent_version_target_id=All&field_operating_system_target_id=436&field_architecture_target_id=All&field_java_package_target_id=All

#### Make sure that you have configured `JAVA_HOME` environment variable & the Java bin path on your regarding OS (Required for both Window & Linux)

- `chmod +x ./gradlew`

- Now try to run `./gradlew assembleDebug` & that should work properly.
- Your Debug apk can be found in your app/build/outputs/apk/debug folder after the compilation.
## Compiling the release build by using:

- Inorder to compile release build make sure that keystore for this code is configured properly and keystore values assigned to the build.gradle file
